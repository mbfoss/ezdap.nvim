---@brief Standalone task runner for ezdap.
---
---Runs a debug task by supplying run callbacks to `ezdap.task.start`, which
---stays provider-agnostic. Every run — `:Debug run`, a run file, or another
---plugin's task — goes through here, so resolving a mode, tracking the run and
---cancelling it are written once.
---
---Every run is shown by a presenter (`ezdap.runner.Presenter`), which takes its
---buffers, its progress and its outcome. ezdap's own runs get the presenter
---`setup` installs; a caller may pass its own and show the run itself. Nothing
---here knows about windows either way.
---
---Who shows a run is separate from who owns it: an `owned` run is ezdap's to tidy
---through `clean` and to replace when its task is re-run, while a run a caller
---presents leaves only through `remove`.
---
---One task per file: a run file returns a single task (or a function
---returning one):
---  -- debug.lua
---  return { name = "debug app", adapter = "lldb", mode = "binary", parameters = { command = "a.out" } }

local M = {}

---@alias ezdap.runner.RunState "running"|"done"|"failed"

---One buffer a run spawned, together with how it asked to be presented.
---@class ezdap.runner.RunBuffer
---@field bufnr integer
---@field opts  ezdap.AddBufOpts

---A run: a unique id, the task name, a cancel function, whoever is showing it
---and how it is faring. Runs are tracked together so tasks can run in parallel.
---@class ezdap.runner.Run
---@field id        string
---@field name      string
---@field cancel    fun()
---@field sessions  integer[]  the sessions this run started, filled in as they start
---@field state     ezdap.runner.RunState
---@field owned     boolean  whether this run's lifetime is ezdap's: what `clean` and re-running act on
---@field presenter ezdap.runner.Presenter  whoever shows this run — ezdap's own display, or a caller's
---@field settled?  boolean  whether the presenter has been told how the run ended

---Whoever shows a run: it takes the run's buffers, progress and outcome through
---these callbacks — the same ones `ezdap.task` speaks — and disposes of what it
---made when the run is forgotten.
---@class ezdap.runner.Presenter : ezdap.TaskCallback
---@field name?       string  run group name (defaults to the adapter's)

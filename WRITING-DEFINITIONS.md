# Writing an adapter definition

One Lua file under an `ndap-adapters/` directory on the runtimepath (beside
`lsp/` and `plugin/`, not under `lua/`). It is configuration: how to reach the
debug adapter — the program that speaks DAP, such as `codelldb` or `gdb
--interpreter=dap` — and what that adapter can be asked to do. It is registered
under its filename: `myadapter.lua` becomes the `myadapter` adapter, the name
`:Ndap run` takes.

DAP's three names, kept distinct:

- **debug adapter** — the program ndap spawns or dials, the one speaking DAP:
  `codelldb`, `lldb-dap`, `dlv dap`.
- **debugger** — what that adapter drives. `codelldb` drives LLDB; `gdb` and
  `dlv` speak DAP directly.
- **debuggee** — the program being debugged.

"Adapter" alone always means the first.

Each file returns one `ndap.AdapterDef`:

```lua
return {
    command  = { "gdb", "--interpreter=dap" }, -- how to spawn the adapter; or host/port to connect
    setup    = function(config, ctx, callback) end, -- optional, see below
    modes    = {
        binary = {
            description = "debug a native executable",
            request     = "launch", -- or "attach"
            inputs      = {
                command = { type = "string", completion = "command", required = true, description = "command line to debug" },
            },
            build       = function(parameters) -- parameters -> DAP body
                local program, args = require("ndap.shared").split_command(parameters.command)
                return { program = program, args = args }
            end,
        },
    },
}
```

A definition is read the first time something reaches for that adapter by name
(`ndap.load_adapter`, a run, `:Ndap adapter_info <adapter>`), never at startup.
Listing adapters (`ndap.available_adapters`, `:checkhealth`) reads filenames
only. Keep top-level work to building the table and put anything expensive in
`setup`, which runs per run. It is read with `loadfile`, not `require`: nothing
can `require` it and it can require no sibling. Helpers come from `ndap.shared`.

## `ndap.AdapterDef`

Every field is optional; what is set decides how the adapter is reached and what
it can run.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | `string` \| `string[]` | Adapter process to spawn, spoken to over stdio. A string is split on shell whitespace (`"python3 -m debugpy"`); a list is verbatim. A missing executable is reported before the session starts. Wins over `host`/`port`: with both set, this spawns and they are ignored. |
| `host` | `string` | Host of an already-running adapter, used only when there is no `command`. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`. No shipped definition sets it; a mode's `build` or a `setup` supplies the connection. |
| `port` | `integer` | Port to connect to, used only when there is no `command`; ndap dials `host:port`, retrying for ~3s. A port set for the run by `setup` or a mode's `build` also selects TCP over `command` — how the shipped `remote` connects. A run with neither a command nor a port is refused before it starts. |
| `cwd` | `string` | Working directory for the spawned adapter. Defaults to Neovim's cwd. |
| `env` | `table<string,string>` | The adapter's own environment, not the debuggee's; merged over Neovim's. Set only what the adapter needs, such as a search path. |
| `type` | `string` | DAP `adapterID` override. Defaults to the filename stem. |
| `defer_launch_attach` | `boolean` | Send `launch`/`attach` after `configurationDone` rather than after `initialize`, for adapters requiring that order. |
| `modes` | `table<string, ndap.Mode>` | The named modes, keyed by the name `:Ndap run <adapter> <mode>` takes. |
| `setup` | `fun(config, ctx, callback)` | Runs before the session; see below. |
| `teardown` | `fun(config, state)` | Runs after the session, with whatever `setup` passed as `state`; also when `setup` fails. |

An `ndap.Mode` is one runnable configuration:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | `string` | A line shown in pickers and `:Ndap new_run_file` output. |
| `request` | `"launch"` \| `"attach"` | Which DAP request the mode issues. |
| `inputs` | `table<string, ndap.Input>` | What the user is asked for, keyed by the name used as `--name`. |
| `build` | `fun(parameters): table?, table\|string?` | Turns inputs into the request body. A second return value is a `host`/`port` table the run should dial; `nil, "message"` aborts. Runs in a coroutine and may yield, so a `vim.ui.select` picker inside it is fine. |

An `ndap.Input` describes one value:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `"string"` \| `"boolean"` \| `"integer"` \| `"number"` \| `"list"` \| `"map"` | Defaults to `string`. `list` is a table of entries, `map` a table of string keys to values — JSON's `array` and `object` under DAP's names. |
| `item_type` | as above, scalars only | The entry type of a `list` or `map`. Defaults to `string`. |
| `required` | `boolean` | Leaving it unset is an error. Defaults to `false`. |
| `completion` | `"file"` \| `"dir"` \| `"command"` \| `string[]` \| `fun(partial): string[]` | What the value completes with. Suggests only; never rejects a value. |
| `description` | `string` | A few words on what the input means, shown by `:Ndap new_run_file` and command-line completion. |

## Modes

A definition without `modes` cannot be run: nothing completes and nothing can be
generated, since a raw DAP body describes nothing about itself (see
[Why inputs](README.md#why-inputs-and-not-raw-dap)). A mode declares the `inputs`
it accepts and a `build` turning `parameters` into the native body:

```lua
return {
    command  = { "my-dap-adapter", "--stdio" },
    modes    = {
        binary = {
            description = "debug an executable",
            request     = "launch",
            inputs      = {
                command       = { type = "string",  completion = "command", required = true, description = "command line to debug" },
                cwd           = { type = "string",  completion = "dir",     description = "working directory" },
                env           = { type = "map",                             description = "environment variables" },
                stop_on_entry = { type = "boolean",                         description = "break at program entry" },
            },
            build = function(parameters)
                local shared = require("ndap.shared")
                local program, args = shared.split_command(parameters.command)
                return {
                    program     = program,
                    args        = args,
                    cwd         = shared.normalize_path(parameters.cwd),
                    env         = parameters.env,
                    stopOnEntry = parameters.stop_on_entry,
                }
            end,
        },
    },
}
```

No further wiring is needed:

```vim
:Ndap run myadapter binary --command ./a.out --cwd /src --stop_on_entry true
:Ndap new_run_file myadapter binary
```

- **`inputs`**: one entry per accepted value, keyed by the name typed at
  `:Ndap run` or written under a run file's `parameters`. `type` is what `build`
  receives and all an input declares about its value. A collection (`list`, or
  `map` with string keys) declares its *entries* under `item_type`:
  `{ type = "list", item_type = "integer" }`; without one, entries are strings.
  A `map` entry is written `key=value`, and a directional one is *described* the
  same way, the key naming the translated side — `local=remote` where the local
  path becomes the remote one, `remote=local` the other way round. The adapter's
  documentation decides which; the two shipped in
  [ndap-adapters.nvim](https://github.com/mbfoss/ndap-adapters.nvim) differ
  because the adapters do. Every type is one row in
  [inputs.lua](lua/ndap/run/inputs.lua), which every consumer reads.
- **`completion`**: a named source (`"file"`, `"dir"`, `"command"` — the last
  completing each token of a command line as a path); the values themselves
  (`{ "console", "terminal" }`); or `fun(partial): string[]` when they can only
  be computed. On a `list`/`map` it describes one entry. Only a written-out set
  reaches the scaffolded file, as a comment. A boolean completes as
  `true`/`false`.
- **Paths and ports**: a path input is a `string` and a port an `integer`; what
  either additionally is, `build` says.
  `shared.normalize_path(parameters.cwd)` resolves `~` and `$VAR` (nil in, nil
  out), `shared.normalize_paths` does the same for a `list`, entry by entry, and
  `shared.resolve_port(parameters.port)` holds a port to its range, returning the
  `nil, err` pair an abort already returns. `normalize_path` is strict: anything
  but a string or nil — a whole `map` where one entry belongs, say — raises, and
  the run reports it as the mode's abort rather than send a body with an empty
  path.
- **`required`**: an unset required input is a resolve error naming the input.
  Otherwise an unset input arrives as `nil`, and Lua drops nil-valued keys, so
  `cwd = parameters.cwd` omits `cwd`. Write the field unconditionally and
  optional fields take care of themselves.
- **`build(parameters)`**: returns the request body — the adapter's own key
  names, plus any identity fields it pins, as literals. `parameters` arrives read
  into each declared `type`, whichever form the caller wrote. A **second** return
  value is the `host`/`port` the run should dial, for an adapter whose connection
  an input configures; return none and the definition's own `host`/`port` stay in
  force. A run with no command and no port is refused before it starts.
- **Aborting**: return `nil` and a message, a string where a successful call
  returns the connection — the ordinary `nil, err` pair.
- **Asking the user**: `build` may yield, which is how an attach mode with no
  `pid` opens a process picker instead of sending a meaningless body: `local pid,
  err = shared.resolve_pid(parameters.pid); if not pid then return nil, err end`.
  Always resume, with a body or an abort.

`:Ndap run`, `:Ndap new_run_file` and mode-based run files all resolve through
this one `parameters` → `build` path, so a mode is described once and the three
cannot drift. The shipped [remote.lua](ndap-adapters/remote.lua) is a compact
reference for a mode returning a connection rather than a body; for a
spawn-then-connect definition, see the example below.

## Setup and teardown

`setup` runs after a mode's `build` and before ndap connects, to start the
adapter as a server and report its port, or to locate its binary and fail with a
readable message. Errors go through `callback("...")`. State passed as the second
argument, `callback(nil, { handle = h })`, arrives as `teardown`'s second
argument, which is how `teardown` stops what `setup` started; hand the same state
back *with* an error and `teardown` runs on the failure too. `callback(err,
state)` must fire exactly once.

`setup` may edit `config` in place, most usefully `config.host`/`config.port`,
which is how a TCP-server adapter gets started and then connected to. A
connection `build` returned is already in `config`; `setup` runs last and may
overwrite it. Its `ctx` carries:

- `report(msg)` — a progress line.
- `add_bufnr(bufnr, opts?)` — attach a buffer `setup` created to the run, so it
  is listed under the session.
- `make_buf_name(kind)` — name a buffer the way the run's own are
  (`:b ndap://<number>/<name>:<kind>`). A reserved kind (`repl`, `output`,
  `term`, `dap`, `log`) or a name already taken is an error rather than a suffix.
- `mode` — the mode name this run resolved from, for gating one mode rather than
  the whole definition (refusing a mode the installed binary is too old for,
  say). Treat an unrecognized `mode` as "none of mine" and proceed.
- `parameters` — the answered inputs `build` was called with, how a `setup` that
  starts the debuggee learns what to start. A raw task names no mode, and so
  carries none.

```lua
local shared = require("ndap.shared")

return {
    setup = function(config, ctx, callback)
        local handle, err
        local done = false -- callback must fire exactly once
        handle, err = shared.spawn({ "my-dap", "--listen", "127.0.0.1:0" }, {
            cwd           = config.cwd,
            bufname       = ctx.make_buf_name("server"),
            line_buffered = true,
            on_stdout     = function(_, lines)
                for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
                    local port = not done and line:match("listening on port (%d+)")
                    if port then
                        done = true
                        config.host, config.port = "127.0.0.1", tonumber(port)
                        callback(nil, { handle = handle })
                    end
                end
            end,
            on_exit       = function(code)
                if done then return end
                done = true
                callback(("my-dap exited (code %d) before reporting a port"):format(code))
            end,
        })
        if not handle then return callback("failed to start my-dap: " .. tostring(err)) end
        ctx.add_bufnr(handle.bufnr, { label = "my-dap server" })
        ctx.report("waiting for server port")
    end,
    teardown = function(_, state)
        if state and state.handle then state.handle.stop() end
    end,
}
```

Any adapter announcing its port on startup fits this shape; only the pattern
matched against its output changes. A `setup` that starts the debuggee is the
same shape one step out, reading the command line from `ctx.parameters`.

## Helpers

`ndap.shared` carries `split_command`, `normalize_path`, `normalize_paths`,
`resolve_port`, `resolve_pid`, `spawn`, and `resolve_path(candidates, accept,
opts?)`, which returns the first candidate `accept` approves and everything
tried:

```lua
local shared = require("ndap.shared")
local exe, tried = shared.resolve_path({ "dlv", "$GOBIN/dlv" }, shared.is_executable)
```

`shared.split_command(command)` splits a `command` input into the
`program`/`args` pair a launch body wants, quotes and backslashes included. It
splits only, passing every token through as written: `~`, `$VAR`, `%`, `#` and
globs are ordinary characters (`./...` stays `./...`), and a list is used
verbatim. Expand a token with `normalize_path` when the field is a path.

An entry is a literal path, never a glob. `$VAR` and `~` expand wherever they
appear, as `vim.fs.normalize` does elsewhere in Neovim; `${VAR}` braces do not. An
entry naming an unset or empty variable is skipped, which is what lets the list
above work with only `$GOBIN` set. A relative entry resolves against `opts.cwd`;
pass no `cwd` for a list of programs, where a bare name is looked up on `$PATH`.

Use `shared.is_directory` for directories, your own predicate when *working*
means more than present (a minimum version, say), and write the file inside a
directory into the entry to test that: a virtualenv's `"$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python"`,
not `"$VIRTUAL_ENV"`.

## Templates

The definitions in
[ndap-adapters.nvim](https://github.com/mbfoss/ndap-adapters.nvim) are worked
examples of the common shapes: an adapter over stdio, one located on `PATH` or in
a package directory, and one started as a server and then connected to. Adapt the
closest. The full contract is in the `ndap.AdapterDef` and `ndap.Mode`
annotations in [lua/ndap/meta.lua](lua/ndap/meta.lua).

New definitions are welcome: follow the structure and comment style of the
existing files, and cite the adapter's documentation the field set is based on at
the top of the file.
